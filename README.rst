Introduction
------------
The **PhaseFieldX** project is designed to simulate and analyze material behavior using phase-field models, which provide a continuous approximation of interfaces, phase boundaries, and discontinuities such as cracks. Leveraging the robust capabilities of *FEniCSx*, a renowned finite element framework for solving partial differential equations, this project facilitates efficient and precise numerical simulations. It supports a wide range of applications, including phase-field fracture, solidification, and other complex material phenomena, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and engineers in materials science.


Purpose
-------
The **PhaseFieldX** project aims to advance phase-field modeling through open-source contributions. By leveraging the powerful *FEniCSx* framework, our goal is to enhance and broaden the application of phase-field simulations across various domains of materials science and engineering. We strive to make these advanced simulation techniques more accessible, enabling researchers and engineers to conduct more accurate and comprehensive scientific investigations. Through collaborative efforts, our mission is to deepen understanding, foster innovation, and contribute to the broader scientific communityâ€™s pursuit of knowledge in complex material behaviors.
